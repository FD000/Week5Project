# Project Name

In this project I have created my own digital version of the old character guessing board game Guess Who?

## The problem

This weeks project's aim was to let us work more with object and arrays where we practice how to loop arrays. This project was a bit harder than previous project and I struggled a lot with the coding and to find information regarding my problems that I faced. I used google, stackoverflow and youtube to find information that could help me tackle my issues. 

If I had more time, I would add more features to my game such as StopWatch and a screen which counts number of attempts the player has performed before the game was finished. I would also like to add more qualities to my characters such as gender etc.
